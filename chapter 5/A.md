**(a)** Infinite loop (no output, program hangs).

**(b)** ```2 3 3```

**(c)** ```3 3 1```

**(d)** Infinite loop (prints "malayalam is a palindrome\n" repeatedly).

**(e)** Infinite loop (prints "10\n" repeatedly).

**(f)** No output (the loop condition x == 1.1 fails due to floating-point precision issues).
